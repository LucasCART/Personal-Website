    <p><b>Chronoshift Expeditions:</b></p>

    <p>One of the websites I made was Chronoshift Website. I created the website with a wireframe in Figma. Figma helped me sketch out ideas and layers of the website. We had a home page, about page, expedition page, rules page, and a book now page. When using Figma, I learned how to add text, images, and color to a layout. The tools in Figma make it possible to visualize your plans on a sample. Each page of the website has navigation to each page. I had to add a “Back to Home” button on each of the pages. One of the biggest challenges I faced when creating my website was getting images to fit in the frame. I cited the images I used by putting the URL below the page. Creating the navigation bar was the easiest part for me. The design was confusing at first. I got really frustrated and wanted to give up. Using Figma showed me the importance of why you need a rough draft to plan out a website. I learned the importance of the CART Habit of Mind “Persist”.</p>

    <p><b>Tourism Website:</b></p>
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/WeVdYiHDGGRqh1sHevYAQx/Tourism-Website" class="button" target="_blank title="Work>Visit my website</a>
    
    <p>One of the websites I made was a Tourism Website. I used Figma to set up the website. The project was a group project and we each had different tasks. We included a home, destinations, about, activities, and visit page. The countries we listed were Germany, Finland, and Japan. When using Figma, we had to include a header and footer for the pages. I learned how to do different devices by creating a tablet and phone version also. One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting images to fit into the frame with the textbox. When I shrank the image it cropped some of it. We were able to fix it by editing the frame. Making the font was the easiest part for me. The design was confusing at first. I got frustrated and wanted to give up. Using Figma showed me the importance of why you need a rough draft to plan out a website.

    <p><b>About Me (Adobe Spark):</b></p>
    <a href="https://express.adobe.com/page/AFDGvuGpbOCqB/" class="button" target="_blank title="Work>Visit my website</a>
    
    <p>The first website I created this year was an “About Me” website, so that people can get to know me better. I used Adobe Spark to create the website. The pages included information about my education, family, friends, future, travel, college, and contact information. I learned how to use a template in order to create the project. The template determines the layout of the page and the format. I had to upload images to the page and include writing for each of the sections. In order to give credit to the used images, we had to cite credit to the creator in the caption. When using the software, one challenge I faced was learning how to set up the text and images on the page. It was my first time using Adobe Spark. Sticking to the format and writing the text was easy for me. The website was difficult to make at first. I got really frustrated and wanted to give up. Using Adobe Spark for the first time showed me the importance of developing a website. I learned the importance of the CART Habit of Mind “Persist”.</p>
    
    <p><b>Choose your own adventure story:</b></p>
    <a href="https://maxsteelfanmade.netlify.app/" class="button" target="_blank title=" work="">Visit my website</a>

    <p>For the “Choose your own adventure story” project, we had to come up with a hero's journey using different possible endings. We made a flowchart and task list for brainstorming. The name of the story we made was “Max Steel”. I learned about making flowcharts when writing the story. Depending whether you choose yes, no, or neutral, the story takes you a different route. Some of our biggest problems were getting our code to start the story and getting our code formatted. It was difficult at first because if we changed something to one part of the format we had to change the entire code. One thing we learned from the code was creating a checkmark in CSS. We had to do some research on our topic. The story had to have 12 steps in the hero's journey. Making the story involved collaboration and communication between setting up our code and dialogue.</p>
